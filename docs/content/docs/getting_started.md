Legato is an audio-graph framework built to make digital signal processing in Rust approachable without sacrificing control. It rethinks the DSP workflow around clarity: nodes represent focused units of audio logic, graphs define their relationships, and the framework handles the orchestration with minimal ceremony.  The result is a system that feels composed rather than cobbled together—one where experimenting with new processing chains, reorganizing signal paths, or integrating custom DSP blocks is straightforward.  Legato’s goal: reduce cognitive load, elevate developer experience, and make high-performance audio programming something you can enjoy rather than endure.
